### ![](https://draexx.github.io) Hi there my name is Pedro ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working in a factory, developing customized systems according to your requirements, as well as teaching in a higher education institute. 
I am looking forward to learn and share all the knowledge about new technologies in order to provide advice on technological solutions.
